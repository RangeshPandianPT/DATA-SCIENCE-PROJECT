### 🔍 Dataset

* **Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
* Contains anonymized features (V1 to V28), transaction amount, time, and class (0 = genuine, 1 = fraud).
* Highly imbalanced: only \~0.17% of transactions are frauds.

---

### 🛠️ Features

* Data normalization using `StandardScaler`
* Class imbalance handling using `SMOTE`
* Model training:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest with `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning
* Model evaluation using:

  * Confusion Matrix
  * Precision, Recall, F1-score
* Feature importance visualization
* Optional: PCA for dimensionality reduction

---

### 📊 Libraries Used

* `pandas`, `numpy`
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* `scikit-learn`
* `imblearn` (for SMOTE)
